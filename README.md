# GroupExplorer

A messy collection of group and graph tools that I use to design my puzzles.


## Highlights

### Generators.java

This is a long list of generators for various groups. 

### PlanarStudy.java

A MinGW G++ installation (mingw32-gcc-g++) is required on Windows:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

GAP is required:
 * Windows: https://www.gap-system.org/install/windows/
 * Linux: Available in most distro package managers

This is a tool that lists out all possible canonical generator pairs (or triples, etc) for a given group.  There are many options for filtering the results.

Note: this only works for small-ish groups, and other manual methods are required for larger ones.

GAP must be on the PATH to use PlanarStudy.

multigenus is a binary that computes the genus of non-planar graphs.  It's only required if using the genus > 1 filter.  Currently only compiled for Linux.

JBliss is a graph canonization library required for PlanarStudy.  I've only compiled it for Linux and Windows x86_64, but it should be possible to compile it for other platforms using the source here:

### GraphVisualizer.java

This is a tool that visualizes the graphs generated by PlanarStudy.  It includes several algorithms for laying out the graphs in 2D or 3D.
