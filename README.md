# GroupExplorer

A messy collection of group and graph tools that I use to design my puzzles.


## Highlights

### Generators.java

This is a long list of generators for various groups. 

### PlanarStudy.java

This is a tool that lists out all possible canonical generator pairs (or triples, etc) for a given group.  There are many options for filtering the results.

JBliss is a graph canonization library required for PlanarStudy.  I've only compiled it for Linux but it should be possible to compile it for other platforms using the source here:

### GraphVisualizer.java

This is a tool that visualizes the graphs generated by PlanarStudy.  It includes several algorithms for laying out the graphs in 2D or 3D.
